Squaring Numbers
You are going to write a List Comprehension to create a new list called squared_numbers. This new list should contain every number in the list numbers but each number should be squared. 

e.g.

4 * 4 = 16

4 squared equals 16.

**DO NOT** modify the List numbers directly. Try to use List Comprehension instead of a Loop. 

Target Output 

[1, 1, 4, 9, 25, 64, 169, 441, 1156, 3025]

    print(squared_list)

# Coding Exercise_16():
    """
    Filtering Even Numbers
    In this list comprehension exercise you will practice using list comprehension to filter out the even numbers from a series of numbers.   
    
    
    
    First, use list comprehension to convert the list_of_strings to a list of integers called numbers.   
    
    Then use list comprehension again to create a new list called result.
    
    This new list should only contain the even numbers from the list numbers. 
    
    Again, try to use Python's List Comprehension instead of a Loop.

Data Overlap
ðŸ’ª This exercise is HARD ðŸ’ª 
Take a look inside file1.txt and file2.txt. They each contain a bunch of numbers, each number on a new line. 
You are going to create a list called result which contains the numbers that are common in both files. 
e.g. if file1.txt contained: 
1 
2 
3
and file2.txt contained: 
2
3
4
result = [2, 3]

#  Coding Exercise 18 Dictionary COmprehension
"""
Dictionary Comprehension 1
You are going to use Dictionary Comprehension to create a dictionary called result that takes each word in the given sentence and calculates the number of letters in each word.   

Try Googling to find out how to convert a sentence into a list of words.  *

*Do NOT** Create a dictionary directly.

Try to use Dictionary Comprehension instead of a Loop. 

To keep this exercise simple, count any punctuation following a word with no whitespace as part of the word. Note that "Swallow?" therefore has a length of 8.
